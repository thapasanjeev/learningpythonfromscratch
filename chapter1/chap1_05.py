# variable

# variable simply stores data. data is assigned in variable.
# example.
number1 = 3 #here the value 3 is assigned to number1. 
print(number1) #output: 3
# operater (=) is an assign operater rather than equal.

#variable can be altered, reassigned or updated by replacing original
#value. This is why it is called variable so that it can vary.

#previously value of number1 was assigned 3 but we can change the value.
number1 = 5
print(number1) #output: 5

#any data types can be assigned to a variable.
name = "sanjeev"
number2 = 98980
float_number= 8.987
#data type can be changed by reassigning value to a variable.
name = 456
#such changing one data type to another data type is known as dynamic programmin language
print(name) #output: 456
